//When I was building clubs and community section, I needed every content to have a timeStamp so that I can find latest contents.
//There I had two options.Either I make changes in content schema or store timeStamp with content id in club and community schema itself
//I choose the second option which was a bad choice because I need timeStamp again for macbease content and it must be embedded
//with content schema itself. Though this decision caused bit of complexity but it will not cause any performance issues.
//In future we can optimize it. So remember that club and community do not use the timestamp of content schema
//but they have their own copy of timeStamp stored for each content.
